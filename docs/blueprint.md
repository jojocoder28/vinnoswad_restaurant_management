## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: A vibrant teal (#008080) evokes a sense of freshness, cleanliness and trust that works well for a food service app.
- Background color: A light gray (#E0E0E0), a desaturated and lightened version of teal. It creates a clean and unobtrusive backdrop that will provide good contrast with the text.
- Accent color: Yellow-gold (#FFD700) offers a complementary contrast for important call-to-actions such as 'approve'.
- Font pairing: 'Poppins' (sans-serif) for headlines and 'PT Sans' (sans-serif) for body text.
- Use clear, modern icons to represent food categories and actions (e.g., plus icon for adding items, checkmark for approval).
- Employ a clean, tab-based layout for different user roles (waiter, manager, admin) and functions (order management, menu editing, reports).
- Subtle animations on order status updates and notifications to enhance user experience (e.g., a small pulse effect on new order alerts).
